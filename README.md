# Data-Driven-Homestay-Pricing-in-NYC
The project aims to contribute to the understanding of the dynamics and characteristics of the Airbnb industry in New York City by utilizing advanced data mining techniques. First, our project analyzes different hosts and areas and identifies the busiest hosts. We then seek to determine the factors that significantly influence the prices of Airbnb listings in the city and identify effective models for price predictions. By enhancing the accuracy of price predictions through predictive modeling, the project provides actionable insights and recommendations to hosts and customers. This improve pricing strategies and ultimately lead to increased satisfaction and profitability for both hosts and customers in the Airbnb market.
